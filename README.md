# XDR-Endpoint-Detections

Endpoint detection engineering and threat analysis using Microsoft Defender XDR
and Microsoft Sentinel (KQL).

This repository focuses on endpoint telemetry, detection logic, false-positive
tuning, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping. It intentionally avoids SOC workflow simulation,
ticketing, or automated incident generation.
